Then, in 1989, enterprising Hong Kong businessman Huang Jiang launched an oil-painting ‘factory’, starting his venture with twenty labourers who were taught to copy canonical Western paintings. Today, Dafen has a population of more than 10,000 people, most of whom are rural migrants turned oil painters. In crammed studios and narrow alleyways, Dafen’s painters turn out thousands of reproductions of celebrated European paintings for the foreign market. To meet their deadlines, the painters sleep on the floor between clotheslines strung with masterpieces. In 2015, the annual turnover in painting sales was estimated at over USD 65 million.\r\n\r\nIn China’s Van Goghs, the father-daughter director team of Haibo and Kiki Tianqi Yu tell the story of one of these painters, Xiaoyong Zhao, who moved to Dafen from Hunan in 1996. Since then, Zhao and his family have painted more than 100,000 replicas of Vincent van Gogh’s paintings, producing meticulous copies for a mere pittance, all the while stifling their own creative instincts. Still, after all these years, Zhao feels a deep affinity with the Dutch painter, identifying most strongly with his struggles to balance a life of creative expression with economic survival. Eventually, Zhao fulfils his lifelong dream to travel to Amsterdam to see van Gogh’s original paintings. In Europe, he experiences an epiphany, as well as heartbreak.\r\n\r\nChina’s Van Goghs is an intimate and affecting documentary that explores how a tremendously skilled painter pursues his life dream, while also reflecting on the challenges and struggles facing millions of workers in a rapidly changing contemporary China.", "tags": [2]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"author": 2, "created_at": "2023-10-17T04:54:56.352Z", "modified_at": "2023-10-17T04:54:56.352Z", "published_at": "2023-10-17T04:52:57Z", "title": "Joint Security Area", "slug": "joint-security-area", "summary": "a movie direct by Park Chan-wook", "content": "Following the success of Kang Je-gyu's Shiri (1999), Joint Security Area is based on the clash between soldiers at Panmunjom on the border between North and South Korea. Two North Korean soldiers are killed in a night-time shooting in the titular Joint Security Area on the border. Two South Korean soldiers are investigated by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission for their involvement in the incident. Park chose not to rely on the visual language and themes built from his preceding two films. He was in full control of his professional creative team, and they acted in concert to harness the full star power and skills of his dream cast (Lee Young-ae, Lee Byung-hun, and Song Kang-ho). The film's popularity established Park Chan-wook as a household name. Joint Security Area was shot in Super 35, with sets specifically built for the film and many scenes shot at night. It took approximately a year and a half of filming and KRW 3 billion to produce and has become a cult classic.\r\n\r\n<h4>about the director</h4>\r\n<strong>Park Chan-wook</strong> (b. 1963, South Korea) studied philosophy at Sogang University in the 1980s. After working as a film critic for many years, Park made his directorial debut with The Moon Is... the Sun's Dream (1992), followed by Trio (1997). His political thriller Joint Security Area (2000) received rave reviews and became the high-grossing film in South Korea at the time. Park then directed Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2001), the first of his ‘Vengeance Trilogy’, followed by Oldboy (2003), which was awarded the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, and Lady Vengeance (2005). After the intense trio, Park directed the offbeat romantic comedy I’m a Cyborg, But That’s OK (2005). In 2009, he subverted expectations with the genre-bending vampire film Thirst. Park made his American debut with Stoker in 2013. Meanwhile, his streak at Cannes continued with The Handmaiden (2016) and Decision to Leave (2022), for which he was awarded Best Director.", "tags": [2]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 5, "fields": {"author": 2, "created_at": "2023-10-17T05:00:08.636Z", "modified_at": "2023-10-17T05:00:08.636Z", "published_at": "2023-10-17T04:59:05Z", "title": "Desicion to leave", "slug": "desicion-to-leave", "summary": "A film directed by Park Chan-wook", "content": "When a man inexplicably falls to his death from a mountain he regularly climbs, seasoned detective Hae-joon (Park Hae-il) and his partner are called upon to investigate the cause of death.

With her demeanour and circumstances raising suspicion, Hae-joon decides to conduct more interviews and tracks her every move. Despite Seo-rae seeming increasingly culpable for the crime as the investigation goes on, Hae-joon cannot stop himself from falling for her.
